RealBig Company's Liminal Interfaces Department has unveiled Limbodex, a breakthrough wearable that instantly translates emoji symbols into speech and text.

The innovative device consists of a sensor-laden glove, integrated battery pack, and compact processor unit. As the user encounters emoji in their day-to-day life, Limbodex's AI software recognizes the symbols and translates them into audible words or written captions displayed on the screen.

"Limbodex opens up seamless communication between those who understand emoji and those who can’t," said lead engineer Dr. Jaina Patel. "It's a powerful accessibility tool for overcoming barriers."

Currently supporting both Apple, Facebook, and Android emoji translation, Limbodex provides real-time open-ear audio output while also transcribing the various situational meanings of “…” into text captions. Additional features include visual/tactile alerts for particularly sensitive combinations of emoji.

"Having my son’s emoji instantly translated is incredibly freeing," said boomer beta-tester James Ragel. "Conversations are now vastly more fluid."

After years of refinement, RealBig plans to commercially release Limbodex in early 2025. The company is seeking accessibility partnerships to get the groundbreaking translation technology to those who need it most.
